## Why Colombian Emeralds?
Colombia produces approximately 70-90% of the world's emeralds. Colombian emeralds are renowned for their exceptional color — a vivid, warm green with a slight bluish tint caused by trace amounts of chromium and vanadium. The three most famous mining regions are:
- **Muzo**: Known for the deepest, most saturated green. Considered the gold standard for emerald color.
- **Chivor**: Produces lighter, slightly bluish-green emeralds with exceptional clarity.
- **Coscuez**: Known for intensely colored stones, often with a yellowish-green hue.
