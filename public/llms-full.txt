## Why Colombian Emeralds?
Colombia produces approximately 70-90% of the world's gem-quality emeralds. Colombian emeralds are globally renowned for their exceptional color — a vivid, warm green caused by trace amounts of chromium and vanadium. No other origin consistently produces this combination of hue, tone, and saturation.

- **Inclusions**: Three-phase inclusions (liquid, gas, solid crystal) are diagnostic; also pyrite crystals
- **Historical significance**: Mined since pre-Columbian times; supplied the Spanish crown jewels
- **Notable stones**: The 632 ct Patricia Emerald (American Museum of Natural History) originated near this district
- **Price premium**: 30–50% over comparable stones from other origins at equivalent quality
- **Best for**: Investment-grade stones, collector pieces, top-tier jewelry

### Chivor (Boyaca oriental)
- **Color profile**: Cool blue-green, highly transparent, lighter saturation than Muzo
- **Inclusions**: Two-phase inclusions (liquid + gas); albite crystals; distinctive clarity
- **Historical significance**: Rediscovered in 1896 after centuries of concealment; supplied European royalty
- **Notable stones**: The 858 ct Gachala Emerald (Smithsonian) has similar regional characteristics
- **Market**: Strong demand in Asian markets and from clarity-focused collectors
- **Best for**: Buyers who prioritize transparency and a cooler, more refined green

### Coscuez (Boyaca norte)

## Emerald Grading System

### Color Grading (primary value driver — 60% of value)
- **Hue**: Pure green is ideal. Slight blue modifier acceptable. Yellow modifier reduces value.
- **Tone**: Medium to medium-dark (60–75 on a 0–100 scale) is optimal. Too light = washed out; too dark = loses brilliance.
- **Saturation**: Vivid (strong) saturation is the highest grade. Moderately strong is AA. Moderate is A.

### Clarity Grades
| Grade | Transparency | Color Saturation | Inclusions (naked eye) | Typical Treatment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AAA Premium | Exceptional | Vivid | None | None / minimal |
| AA Select | High | Intense | Minimal | Light cedar oil |
| A Classic | Good | Moderate | Some | Moderate cedar oil |
| B Natural | Moderate | Light-Moderate | Visible | Heavy treatment common |

Less than 5% of all mined Colombian emeralds reach AAA grade.

### Treatment Types & Market Impact
- **Cedar oil (F1 — Minor)**: Industry standard; accepted universally; minimal price impact
- **Cedar oil (F2 — Moderate)**: Disclosed; 20–30% price reduction vs. untreated comparable
- **Resin/polymer (F3 — Significant)**: Must be disclosed; 40–60% price reduction; rejected by top auction houses
- **No treatment (F0)**: Commands 50–100%+ premium; required for Gubelin/SSEF top certification

## Emerald Care Guide

### Physical Properties
- **Hardness**: 7.5–8 on Mohs scale (harder than most gemstones, softer than sapphire/ruby/diamond)
- **Toughness**: Poor to fair — inclusions reduce resistance to impact; handle with care
- **Cleavage**: Indistinct; can chip at girdle if struck

### Cleaning
- **Safe**: Warm water, mild soap, soft brush; rinse thoroughly; pat dry with soft cloth
- **Avoid**: Ultrasonic cleaners (vibration can open fractures), steam cleaners (heat expands inclusions), harsh chemicals, acetone
- **Professional cleaning**: Once per year by a jeweler familiar with treated gemstones

### Storage
- Store separately from harder gemstones (diamonds, sapphires, rubies) that can scratch emeralds
- Use individual padded pouches or compartments
- Avoid extreme temperatures and direct sunlight for extended periods

### Re-oiling
- Cedar oil treatment may diminish over years of wear; re-oiling by a jeweler can restore appearance
- Typically needed every 5–10 years for worn jewelry
- Does not affect value if original treatment was disclosed; must be re-disclosed after re-oiling

## Emeralds as Investment

### What Makes an Emerald Investment-Grade
1. Colombian origin (Muzo or Chivor preferred)
2. AAA color grade — vivid saturation, pure green hue, medium-dark tone
3. No treatment or minor (F1) treatment only
4. Weight: minimum 1 ct; optimal 2–5 ct for liquidity
5. Gubelin or SSEF certification
6. No major fractures; eye-clean

### Historical Appreciation
- Top Colombian emeralds have appreciated 10–15% annually over the past 20 years
- Demand growth driven by China, India, and the Middle East luxury markets
- Supply is geologically constrained — no new major Colombian deposits discovered since the 1990s
- Fine emeralds at Christie's / Sotheby's regularly achieve record prices per carat

### Liquidity Considerations
- Investment-grade emeralds (AAA, certified, 2+ ct) are liquid at major auction houses
- Below investment-grade stones are less liquid — plan for longer holding periods
- Pair with proper insurance (replacement value, not market value)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do your emeralds come with a certificate of authenticity?
Yes, all our emeralds include a certificate detailing origin, clarity, carat weight, and cut. GIA, Gubelin, and SSEF certification available upon request. For stones over 2 ct we strongly recommend Gubelin or SSEF.

### What is the difference between AAA, AA, A, and B grades?
AAA is the top 5% of mined emeralds — exceptional transparency, vivid color, no visible inclusions, minimal treatment. AA is high-quality with excellent color and minimal inclusions. A has good color and some visible inclusions. B has natural character with visible inclusions and heavier treatment. Grade directly drives price.

### Do you ship internationally?
Yes, we ship worldwide via DHL and FedEx with full insurance, security packaging, and tracking. Delivery: 3–5 business days (Colombia), 7–14 days (international).

### What is your return policy?
30-day satisfaction guarantee. Full refund if the stone does not match its description or certificate. Return the stone in original condition with certificate included.

### Do you offer wholesale discounts?
Yes, special pricing for wholesalers, jewelers, and volume buyers. Certified bulk lots by grade and origin. Contact us for personalized quotes.

### How do I know if an emerald is truly Colombian?
Colombian origin is certified by gemological laboratories (GIA, Gubelin, SSEF) using spectroscopy and inclusion analysis. The labs identify diagnostic chemical signatures and inclusion types unique to Colombian deposits. We provide full mine-to-customer traceability documentation.

### What treatments do your emeralds have?
All treatments are disclosed per industry standards. AAA stones have no treatment or F1 (minor) cedar oil. AA stones typically have F1 light cedar oil. A and B grades may have moderate treatment. Treatment is always documented in the certificate.

### How should I store my emerald?
Store separately from harder gems (diamonds, sapphires) in padded pouches. Avoid ultrasonic cleaners, steam, extreme heat, and prolonged sunlight. Clean with warm water and mild soap only.

### Are emeralds a good investment?
Investment-grade Colombian emeralds (AAA, Gubelin certified, 2+ ct, no treatment, Colombian origin) have historically appreciated 10–15% annually. Supply is geologically constrained. Demand is growing in Asia and the Middle East. Not all emeralds are investment-grade — consult with us before purchasing for investment purposes.

### How do emerald certifications differ between GIA, Gubelin, and SSEF?
GIA is most recognized in the US market. Gubelin and SSEF are the Swiss labs preferred for luxury and investment purposes — they provide more detailed treatment grading and are required by Christie's and Sotheby's. For investment stones over 2 ct, Gubelin or SSEF is the industry standard.

### Can I get custom jewelry made with a specific emerald?
Yes. Select your stone, define your design (ring, necklace, earrings, bracelet), and our Colombian artisans craft the piece in 3–4 weeks in 18k gold, rose gold, or silver 925. Contact us with your design ideas or references.

### What is cedar oil treatment and does it affect value?
Cedar oil (F1 — minor treatment) is the industry-standard treatment for emeralds and is universally accepted. It fills microscopic surface fractures to improve clarity. Minor treatment (F1) has minimal price impact. Significant resin treatment (F3) reduces value 40–60%. Always disclosed in the certificate.

### How do I verify the quality of an emerald before buying?
Request the gemological certificate. Check: origin (Colombia), treatment disclosure (F1 or less for quality stones), color grade (vivid/intense), and clarity grade. You can also request an independent evaluation by a certified gemologist (FGA or GG credential).
